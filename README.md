# FB SVG Clipper

**FB (FreeBasic) SVG Clipper** is a tool that allows to **clip images** using the **BÃ©zier tool** and exports it in a **SVG file**  with a linked and clipped image.

The code is released under the terms of the *GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3*. It works on Windows an Linux environnements.

FB SVG CLipper is written in [**FreeBasic language**](http://www.freebasic.net). I appreciate that other FreeBasic's users share their knowledge, see [aknowledgments](aknowledgments.md).

## User guide

To launch the program input as arguments the name of the fvg file to open (_if it doesn't exist it will be created when saving_) and a valid JPG file. The program should be launched by the command-line.

Example (_windows_):

`fbvg filename.fvg filename.jpg`

At the moment it's important that both `fvg file` and `image file` are in the same folder of the program.
